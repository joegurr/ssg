    <h4>Arzel√†-Ascoli Theorem</h4>

    <p>Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be an equicontinuous family from a separable metric space \((X, d_X)\) to a
    complete metric space \((Y, d_Y)\) such that \(\overline{\{f_n(x) : 0 \leq n < \infty \}}\) is compact for
    all \(x\). </p>

    <p>Then there is a subsequence \(\{f_{n_j}\}_{j=1}^\infty\) converging pointwise to a
    continuous function and the convergence is uniform on compact subsets. </p>

    <h5>Corollary</h5>
    <p>Let \(\{f_n :
    [0,1] \to \mathbb{R} \}\) be uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. Then some subsequence
    converges in \(C[0,1]\).</p>
